# Hyphe: web corpus curation tool & links crawler

Welcome to [Hyphe](http://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr), a research-driven web crawler developped at the [Sciences Po m√©dialab](http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/) for the [DIME-SHS Web project (ANR-10-EQPX-19-01)](http://www.sciencespo.fr/dime-shs/).

Hyphe aims at providing a tool to build web corpus by crawling data from the web and generating networks between what we call "web entities", which can be single pages as well as a website, subdomains or parts of it, or even a combination of those.

## Demo

You can try a limited version of Hyphe at the following url: [http://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/demo/](http://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/demo/)


## How to install?

Before running Hyphe, you may want to adjust the settings first. The default config will work but you may want to tune it for your own needs. There is a procedure to change the configuration after the installation. However we recommend to take a look at the [Configuration documentation](doc/config.md) for detailed explanation of each available option.


### Migrating older versions

Hyphe has changed a lot in the past few years. Migrating from an older version by pulling the code from git is not guaranteed anymore, it is highly recommended to reinstall from scratch. Older corpora can be rebuilt by exporting the list of web entities from the old version and recrawl from that list of urls in the new Hyphe.


### Easy install: using Docker

For an easy install either on Linux, Mac OS X or Windows, the best solution is to rely on [Docker](https://www.docker.com).

Docker enables isolated install and execution of software stacks, which helps installing easily a whole set of dependencies.

Docker's containers are sizeable: you should ensure **at least 4GB** of empty space is available before installing.

#### 1. Install Docker

First, you should deploy **Docker** on your machine following its [official installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).

Once you've got Docker installed and running, you will need **Docker Compose** to set up and orchestrate Hyphe services in a single line. Docker Compose is already installed along with Docker on Windows and Mac OS X, but you may need to [install it for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


#### 2. Download Hyphe

Collect Hyphe's sourcecode from this git repository (recommended way to benefit from future updates) or download and uncompress a [zipped release](https://github.com/medialab/hyphe/releases), then enter the resulting directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/medialab/hyphe.git hyphe
cd hyphe
```


#### 3. Configure

Then, copy the default configuration files and edit them to adjust the settings to your needs:

```bash
# use "copy" instead of "cp" under Windows powershell
cp .env.example .env
cp config-backend.env.example config-backend.env
cp config-frontend.env.example config-frontend.env
```

The `.env` file lets you configure:
+ `TAG`: the reference Docker image you want to work with among
  + `prod`: for the latest stable release
  + `preprod`: for intermediate unstable developments
+ `PUBLIC_PORT`: the web port on which Hyphe will be served (usually 80 for a single service server, or for a shared host any other port you like which will need to be redirected)
+ `DATA_PATH`: using Hyphe can quickly consume several gigabytes of hard drive. By default, volumes will be stored within Docker's default directories but you can define your own path here.

  **WARNING:** `DATA_PATH` MUST be either empty, or a full absolute path including leading and trailing slashes (for instance `/var/opt/hyphe/`).

  It is not currently supported under Windows, and should always remain empty in this case (so you should install Hyphe from a drive with enough available space).
+ `RESTART_POLICY`: the choice of autorestart policy you want Hyphe containers to apply
  + `no`: (default) containers will not be restarted automatically under any circumstance
  + `always`: containers will always restart when stopped
  + `on-failure`: containers will restart only if the exit code indicates an on-failure error
  + `unless-stopped`: containers will always restart unless when explicitly stopped

  If you want Hyphe to start automatically at boot, you should use the `always` policy and make sure the Docker daemon is started at boot time with your service manager.

Hyphe's internal settings are adjustable within `config-backend.env` and `config-frontend.env`. Adjust the settings values to your needs following [recommendations from the config documentation](doc/config.md).

If you want to restrict Hyphe's access to a selected few, you should leave `HYPHE_OPEN_CORS_API` false in `config-backend.env`, and setup `HYPHE_HTPASSWORD_USER` & `HYPHE_HTPASSWORD_PASS` in `config-frontend.env` (use `openssl passwd -apr1` to generate your password's encrypted value).


#### 4. Prepare the Docker containers

You have two options: either collect, or build Hyphe's Docker containers.

+ **Recommended: Pull** our official preassembled images from the Docker Store

  ```bash
  docker-compose pull
  ```

+ **Alternative: Build** your own images from the source code (mostly for development or if you intend to edit the code, and for some very specific configuration settings):

  ```bash
  docker-compose build
  ```

Pulling should be faster, but it will still take a few minutes to download or build everything either way.


#### 5. Start Hyphe

Finally, start Hyphe containers with the following command, which will run Hyphe and display all of its logs in the console until stopped by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Or run the containers as a background daemon (for instance for production on a server):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


#### 6. Stop and monitor Hyphe

To stop containers running in background, use `docker-compose stop` (or `docker-compose down` to also clean relying data).

You can inspect the logs of the various Docker containers using `docker-compose logs`, or with option `-f` to track latest entries like with `tail`.

Whenever you change any configuration file, restart the Docker container to take the changes into account:

```bash
docker-compose stop
docker-compose up -d
```

Run `docker-compose help` to get more explanations on any extra advanced use of Docker.

If you encounter issues with the Docker builds, please report an [issue](https://github.com/medialab/hyphe/issues) including the "Image ID" of the Docker images you used from the output of `docker images` or, if you installed from source, the last commit ID (read from `git log`).


#### 7. Update to future versions

If you installed from git by pulling our builds from DockerHub, you should be able to update Hyphe to future minor releases by simply doing the following:

```bash
docker-compose down
git pull
docker-compose pull
# eventually edit your configuration files to use new options
docker-compose up -d
```


### Manual install (complex and only for Linux)

If your computer or server relies on an old Linux distribution unable to run Docker, if you want to contribute to Hyphe's backend development, or for any other personal reason, you might want to rather install Hyphe manually by following the [manual install instructions](doc/install.md).

Please note there are many dependencies which are not always trivial to install and that you might run in quite a bit of issues. You can ask for some help by [opening an issue](https://github.com/medialab/hyphe/issues) and describing your problem, hopefully someone will find some time to try and help you.

Hyphe relies on a web interface with a server daemon which must be running at all times. When manually installed, one must start, stop or restart the daemon using the following command (without `sudo`):

```bash
bin/hyphe <start|restart|stop> [--nologs]
```

By default the starter will display Hyphe's log in the console using `tail`. You can use `Ctrl+C` whenever you like to stop displaying logs without shutting Hyphe down. Use the `--nologs` option to disable logs display on start. Logs are always accessible from the `log` directory.

All settings can be configured directly from the global configuration file `config/config.json`. Restart Hyphe afterwards to take changes into account: `bin/hyphe restart`.


### Serve Hyphe on the web

As soon as the Docker containers or the manual daemon start, you can use Hyphe's web interface on your local machine at the following url:
- Docker install: [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
- manual install: [http://localhost/hyphe](http://localhost/hyphe).

For personal uses, you can already work with Hyphe as such. Although, if you want to let others use it as well (typically if you installed on a distant server), you need to serve it on a webserver and make a few adjustments.

Read the [dedicated documentation](doc/serve.md) to do so.
